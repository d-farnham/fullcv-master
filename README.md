# fullcv

These are the source files for my CV, built in latex using the `moderncv` template and `biblatex` (via `biber`) for bibliographies.
Most of the files have been adapted from *James Doss-Gollin's* repository at his GitHub page. Thanks, James!
The code isn't beautifully written, but it's effective for what it does.
Thanks to the authors of the packages, and in particular *Xavier Danaux* who authored the `moderncv` package and created a template that was my starting point.
